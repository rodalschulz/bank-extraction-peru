This is my first PC app project ever, coded in python.

Basically, it's just a program that will extract bank transaction data from peruvian banks by using selenium.

The user will login into their bank account (choose from 5 bank options). Once logged in, the program will automatically extract all transaction data from every bank account that the user mantains in that bank. 

The program will then show the extracted data and push it into a CSV file, only if the data is new.

This program will allow the user to have all their bank transactions from different bank accounts and from different banks in a single CSV file and format.
